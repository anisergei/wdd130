    <h1>Ani Harutyunyan | WDD 130</h1>
    <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Ani Harutyunyan" width="200">
    <p>Hello! My name is Ani. I was born in 1990 in a small beautiful town Vanadzor, Armenia. I was the third child of
        four siblings. I started school when I was six but shortly after that in the year 1999 my parents sent me
        to India, West Bengal, Kolkata to continue my education there.

        In India, I attended an Armenian school that was known as Armenian College and Philanthropic
        Academy. I was blessed to be able to learn English during my school years. I was doing quite well at
        school and besides that, I was able to participate in some sports. I played basketball in school and I was
        given the honor to be the captain of the team. I also learned Indian dancing and had the opportunity to
        perform in New Delhi and Hong Kong.

        In the year 2007, I came back to Armenia and completed my last year of school here in Armenia. In the
        same year, I met the missionaries and I was excited to learn about the gospel. Shortly after I decided to
        get baptized this was one of my best decisions because then came all the blessings that were promised
        to those who keep and follow their covenants.

        I met my husband who was a returned missionary in the year 2009 in a young single adultâ€™s activity.
        Shortly after that, we were married and sealed in the temple and were blessed with 3 beautiful children,
        a son who is 13, and our daughters are 11 and 4.</p>
